This module stochastically computes an EV load profile based on an occupancy profile and predefined parameters 
(such as the type of car and driver usage) for a time horizon ranging from 1 day to 1 year, minute by minute.

Main Assumptions:

    1. The charging pattern is 'uncontrolled,' i.e., as soon as the EV comes back home, it charges at the nominal 
    charger power (which is an input) until fully charged.
    2. Each departure in the occupancy profile corresponds to a departure with the EV, except for departures that 
    last less than 10 minutes, which are not considered as EV usage.
    3. At each EV departure, a probability is computed (depending on the energy available in the EV and the energy 
    required for the journey) for the EV to be refueled and charged during this departure, outside the home.
    4. When a charge occurs away from home (see above), a percentage of the full departure time is taken,
    stochastically, for the EV to be charged. It's assumed to be at the midpoint of the journey and is an instantaneous 
    charge.
    5. The outside battery refuel is defined such that E_come_back_home <= SOC_max - E_spent_half_departure and 
    E_come_back_home >= SOC_min.

Inputs:

    - Occupancy profile, which details whether the main driver is at home (1) or not (0), with a length of N, the 
    number of minutes considered in the simulation time horizon.
    - Probability of the EV size ['small', 'medium', 'large'], corresponding to different battery capacities defined 
    in config_init_.py as 37, 60, and 100 kWh.
    - Probability of driver usage ['short', 'normal', 'long'], which defines the type of driver journeys to simulate. 
    The 'normal' type corresponds to the statistical mean daily kilometers: 50 km/weekday and 60 km/weekend-day. 
    'Short' corresponds to smaller journeys (30% of 50 km and 30% of 60 km), and 'long' doubles the distances (200% of 
    50 km and 200% of 60 km). All of these distances are then stochastically varied for each journey to simulate daily 
    variations.

Outputs:

    It returns several time series, such as the load profile of EV charging, the SOC evolution of the car, when the 
    car is plugged in, and when a charge event occurs away from home. The load profile associated with the occupancy
    profile can be merged and used for further flexibility analysis.
